### Vitamin A
Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays an essential role in maintaining vision, body growth, immune function and reproductive health.

Peformed vitamin A, also know as retinol, **is only found in animal-sourced foods, such as oily fish, liver, cheese and butter.**

Your body can produce vitamin A from carotenoids found in darkly colored fruits and vegetables, also known as provitamin A. However, about 45% of people carry a genetic mutation that significantly reduces their ability to convert provitamin A into vitamin A (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).
